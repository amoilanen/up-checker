- Expose simple dummy JSON endpoint, add first unit test
- Use PostgreSQL as a DB
- Expose /groups (GET, POST)
  -- Simplify Json reads and writes -- error
  -- Handle properly error conditions when calling dao.create
  -- Add unit tests
  -- Test for error conditions:
     --- invalid JSON
     --- Group with such a name already exists
- Expose /groups/{group-name} (PUT, DELETE)
group is defined by its name

- Expose endpoint /groups/{group-name}/services (GET, POST)
service is defined by name and URL, possibly also by type (database, web server, host)
- Expose /groups/{group-id}/services/{service-id} (PUT, DELETE)

- Expose /service-states/{service-id} (GET) (?)
  -- When queried for service states, query the actual service state
- Expose /group-states/{group-id}

- When invalid JSON body is provided, respond with correct validation errors?
